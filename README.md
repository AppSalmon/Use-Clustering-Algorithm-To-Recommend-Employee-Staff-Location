# Use Clustering Algorithm To Recommend Employee Staff Location
**Abstract**: *Nowadays, the picking up of the staff by shuttle bus every morning is a
significant activity of every big company. With a limited number of vehicles and the
information from the staff’s residence survey, the manager can consider some fixed bus
stations that minimize the staff’s moving distances. To solve this problem, in this research,
our group used K-means clustering algorithm to subdivide by area of employees near each
other, based on the input data is a list of employee addresses, we then encode the address
using the ArcGIS API and calculate distance matrix as crow flies based on longitude -
latitude converted to polar coordinates. Based on the clusters, our group also study the
convex hull algorithm to find out the boundary of every group of staff and visualize it on
the map for viewing purpose. The result is a map on which the coordinate points of bus 
stops or employee accommodation are visually divided and can help businesses or
companies easily find suitable bus stops, rational and optimal.*
